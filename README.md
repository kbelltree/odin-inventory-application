## Key Project Instructions

The project was developed following these main guidelines:

- Set up routes, controllers, views folders.

- Make all the forms for create and update the inventory.

- Develop the controllers that manages inventory data.

- Add delete function.

- Using a new local PostgreSQL database test the application by adding fake data.

- Deploy the app.
